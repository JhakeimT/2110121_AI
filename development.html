            <h2>Reflections from "Twelve Pillars"</h2>
            <p>The book Twelve Pillars by Jim Rohn and Chris Widener offers important lessons on personal growth and success. In Chapters 4–7, the authors focus on personal development, discipline, the people you surround yourself with, and taking responsibility for your life. Mr. Davis teaches Michael that success comes from always improving yourself, being around positive people, and taking small, consistent actions. These ideas have really stuck with me as a college student studying computer networking. I’ve realized that, just like in technology, continuous learning is essential to stay up-to-date, so I now make time every day to learn about new trends and developments in networking. I’ve also become more careful about who I spend time with, as their attitudes can either push me forward or hold me back. I’m focusing on building better habits by making small daily efforts in my studies instead of relying on bursts of motivation. Lastly, I’ve taken full responsibility for my academic and career growth, looking for internships and hands-on experiences to prepare for my future. These lessons have not only helped me in my studies but have also shaped how I approach success in my personal and professional life. I’ve learned to set clear goals, build strong relationships, and always keep learning.</p>
